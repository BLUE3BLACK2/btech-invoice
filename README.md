This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in the values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

| Variable | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_NOTES` | Default notes for new invoices, such as payment details. Use `\n` for line breaks. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_SIGNATURE` | Default signature image for new invoices, as a `data:image/webp;base64,...` URL. Use a transparent image cropped to the signature. |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_SIGNATORY` | Default signatory name printed under the signature. |

When a variable is empty, new invoices reuse the value from the latest saved invoice.

`.env.local` is ignored by git, so payment details never end up in the repository. Set the same variable in your hosting provider when deploying.

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
